## Introduction
SmartMesh是一个基于区块链token激励机制的开放式、共享型Mesh网络基础协议，SmartMesh生态的本质是一个庞大的通证生态。生态的建设离不开SmartMesh开发者社区，SmartMesh开发者社区希望吸引全球对SmartMesh项目感兴趣的朋友，一起交流一起讨论，可以从理论开始探讨，从不同维度和视角思考SmartMesh的生态体系，从更高的维度对SmartMesh和MeshBox提出面向未来的规划和需求，并参与实施与落地。我们希望这是一个很科幻，很脑洞的社区，鼓励乌托邦式的想法，仰望星空但要脚踏实地，所以开发者社区会大力激励有创想有能力的开发人才，一起大胆的想，大胆的干！


SmartMesh is an open, shared Mesh network protocol that works on blockchain-based tokenized incentive mechanisms. Now a developer community is being launched in hopes of attracting developers from around the world to work on SmartMesh projects. At first, we can look at potential projects from theoretical and abstract perspectives. 
Devising concepts for SmartMesh and MeshBox projects is an imaginative process. We hope that our community can embrace the unbridled innovation of science fiction, the knowledge of academia and engineering, and the vision of utopian ideals.  We are seeking far more than just "coders", but true innovators who can write the chapters of the future for human civilization into an ambitious and robust ecosystem! 


## Unique concept
区块链思维：社区成员是一个个区块链节点，鼓励连接和价值传递，平等，独立，自由，有价值的观点、成果，会得到尊重和激励。

Community members are blockchain nodes who will be respected and incentivized, and that encourage connectivity and value transfers, equality, independence, freedom, valuable perspectives, and results.

## Operating mechanism
一个分布式自治模式的区块链开发者社区
An autonomous community of blockchain developers.

解读：我们希望开发者社区，不要消耗公司过多的精力来管理，只需要很少的公司内部人员就可以完成协作。开发者社区吸引世界上对SmartMesh项目感兴趣的开发者，社区成员作为一个个区块链节点，按照我们设定的共识机制，自组织，自管理，自运行。

Interpretation: We want the developer community to avoid devoting too much energy to management, and only require a few core members to collaborate on organizational tasks. The developer community will attract developers from around the world who are interested in SmartMesh projects. Community members act as blockchain nodes that are self-organizing, self-managing, and self-running according to the consensus mechanism we have implemented.

社区共识机制：
Community Consensus Mechanism:

Proof of Capability (POC)（这是spectrum公链的共识机制，把区块链运行的方式放到开发者社区，所以这是真正的区块链社区）

Proof of Capability (POC) (the Spectrum public chain's consensus mechanism, integrating the developer community into a 'true' blockchain community)

社区为了达到自组织，自运行，需要社区成员组织起来，分工合作，都来参与社区的协作。

In order to achieve self-organization and self-operation, the community needs its members to organize, work together, and collaborate.

社区分为四个模块，每个模块由节点组成，每个节点其实是开发者社区成员。

The community is divided into four modules that consist of nodes which are actually members of the developer community. These are:

1）激励模块：负责审核社区smt token激励的预算，审核和发放。

 Incentive Module: Responsible for reviewing the budget, and reviewing and releasing of community SMT Token incentives.

2）需求池模块：对内负责收集和提交对SmartMesh好的意见和想法，对外收集和整理目前公司内部暂时做不了的需求，适当放出一些。每周出一些主题题目，鼓励社区成员pr，获得奖励。

Demand Pool Module: Responsible for collecting and submitting good suggestions and ideas for SmartMesh, collecting and sorting out the current needs of the company, and releasing some of them appropriately. They will also generate some topics every week and encourage community members to earn rewards.

3）审核决策模块：审核复杂有争议的事物，最高决策节点。如：当社区运行出错时，对形势进行判断，进行回滚或者暂停社区运行的决策。

Audit Evaluation Module: The highest decision-making nodes. Reviewing complex and controversial events and issues. For example, when the community goes awry, this node will pass judgement on the situation and make a decision whether or not to roll back or suspend the community operation.

4）开发者模块：通过审核的有能力（开发能力）节点，接需求池的需求，固定时间完成需求任务获得奖励。将是一个弱中心化组织，各节点群出块（正确做事），可以获得奖励。

Developer Module: These nodes will audit development capability according to the requirements released by SmartMesh, and will be rewarded at fixed times. It will be a weakly centralized organization, and each node group generates blocks (by acting correctly) and earns rewards.

## SMT Rewards
1）做任务，获得smt奖励。任务包括但不限于写文章或者提交代码；具体任务需求每周再讨论。

 Complete tasks and earn SMT rewards. Tasks include, but are not limited to, writing articles or submitting code; different tasks will be released on a weekly basis.

2）技术分享，获得smt奖励。包括但不限于区块链技术，无网mesh技术，AI，任何对SmartMesh生态有价值的技术，都可以。

Share technology and earn SMT rewards. Including but not limited to blockchain technology, MESH technology, AI, and any technology that is valuable to the SmartMesh ecosystem.

3）理论创新，获得奖励。从理论开始探讨，从不同维度和视角思考SmartMesh的生态体系，从更高的维度对SmartMesh和MeshBox提出面向未来的规划和需求。

Devise innovative theories, concepts and plans and earn rewards. Contemplating future directions and possibilities for SmartMesh's ecosystem from different dimensions and perspectives, and proposing future-oriented planning and requirements for SmartMesh and MeshBox.


## Recruit
社区成员的对象：对区块链技术具有强烈学习兴趣的全球IT开发者。

Community Member Pre-requisites: Global IT developers with a strong interest in blockchain technology, a passion for innovation, and a creative approach to community development and involvement.

社区成员加入方式：邀请或者申请，有一个门槛设置，比如提交申请（比如您可以告诉我们您可以施展你的才能帮助社区做什么？），或者我们会邀请有行业影响力或者技术影响力的朋友。

How community members join: By invitation or application. This could be as easy as you telling us what you can do to help the SmartMesh ecosystem develop. Simultaneously, we will invite candidates who we have identified to possess industry or technical experience, influence and prowess.
